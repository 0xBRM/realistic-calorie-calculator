# realistic-calorie-calculator
Basic command line utility written in python 3 that uses specific data points to determine basal metabolism requirements, as well as the average caloric deficits over a period of time.

**Note:** overly short time periods will result in increasingly inaccurate results, as no calculator can take factors like water retention into account (trivial to implement, but stupid and borderline obsessive to check this on a daily basis).
